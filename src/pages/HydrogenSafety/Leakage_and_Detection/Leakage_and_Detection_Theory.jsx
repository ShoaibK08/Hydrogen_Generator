            Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless gas, which makes detecting leaks a significant challenge. Even small leaks can pose serious safety risks due to hydrogen's flammability and the potential for explosions. Hydrogen molecules are also smaller and lighter than other gases, allowing them to escape through minute openings or cracks in storage and transportation systems. To ensure safety, it is crucial to implement advanced leak detection technologies, such as sensors that can detect hydrogen concentrations in the air. These sensors should be placed at strategic locations, including refueling stations and storage areas, to provide early warnings of potential leaks. Regular maintenance and inspection of hydrogen systems are equally important to identify and prevent leakage, ensuring safe operations and minimizing the risk of accidents.</p>
